#Although we have already used the multiple words variables.
#To make sure our code is bugless we may learn some concepts regrding the multiple word variable names that is given below-

#A variable in Python can have either a short name (e.g. x and y) or a longer, more descriptive name (e.g. age, carname, total_volume).

#It is important to remember that variable names must always start with a letter or the underscore character
#cannot begin with a number, and can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
#variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that variables such as age, Age, and AGE are all treated as separate entities.

#Legal variable names:

firstName = "S M ASIFUL ISLAM"
last_name = "Saky"
_my_address = "AIU, Kedah, MY"
MYPHONENO = "8498465146"
myPhone_No2 = "8116846845"

#Let's print these and see how it works exactly-

print(firstName)
print(last_name)
print(_my_address)
print(MYPHONENO)
print(myPhone_No2)


#Illegal variable names:
#2firstname = "S M ASIFUL ISLAM"
#last-name = "Saky"
#my address = "AIU, Kedah, MY"

#If you run these, You'll see these will show the output as Syntax error.

#print(2firstname)
#print(last-name)
#print(my address)
